# TODO List:

* Use a style.css document to make it easy to change CSS settings and to make the code clearer.
* Try the same with .js files, 'cause why not.
* Encrypt the number in the UNV file a bit better (Even if it's just something like: Palindrome(10000 - Palindrome(number)), so the decryption will be exactly the same).
* Add "about.html" page.
* **FIX THE CSS, ADD MEDIA QUERIES**
* Show favicon rather than download it.
* _Get Hiveworks' time of upload._
